<p>Hey there! I'm RICHARD JOSHUA, a beginner full-stack web developer excited about coding. I just got the hang of HTML and now I'm jumping into the worlds of CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<p>My coding journey started out of curiosity, and now I'm on a mission to make websites look cool and do interesting things. I'm still learning the ropes, but each little victory feels like leveling up in a game. CSS and JavaScript are my next challenges, and I can't wait to see what I can create with them.</p>

<p>Being a beginner means I'm still figuring things out. Debugging is like solving puzzles, and sometimes it feels like talking to the computer in its own language. But that's the fun part! I'm building the foundation for making awesome websites, step by step.</p>

<p>Come along on this journey with meâ€”from understanding HTML to becoming a full-stack wizard. I might be a beginner, but I'm passionate about learning and sharing the adventure. Let's dive into the world of web development together!</p>
